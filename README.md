# Indonesian-News-Online-Headline-Text-Analysis
Hello everyone!

In this repository, I will share with you my codes and works for analysis on Indonesian news online headline text analysis about "Slow Loris Conservation". For the starters, I will dump everything that I do and know about this and will try to sort and clean my codes for the time being.

My background is not from computer science, thus I tend to use my own "terms" to name files, row, column, folder, categories, etc. So please bear with me ._.

I also use other people code in this project. If you notice that I use code that is exclusively yours, please do tell me. 

If you have any questions, critiques, or suggestions, please feel free to email me at fattrezaihsan@gmail.com or to message my LinkedIn profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/fattrezaihsan/

Thank you!
